      Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional 
      foods of Japan, which have developed through centuries of 
      political, economic, and social changes. The traditional 
      cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on rice with 
      miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal 
      ingredients. Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled 
      vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is 
      common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in 
      sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light 
      batter, as tempura. Apart from rice, a staple includes 
      noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also has many simmered 
      dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in 
      sukiyaki and nikujaga.

      Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine 
      has also opened up to influence from Western cuisines in the 
      modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign food—in particular 
      Chinese food—like ramen and gyōza, as well as foods like 
      spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers, have been adapted to 
      Japanese tastes and ingredients. Traditionally, the Japanese 
      shunned meat because of Buddhism, but with the modernization 
      of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as tonkatsu and 
      yakiniku have become common. Japanese cuisine, particularly 
      sushi and ramen, has become popular throughout the world.

      In 2011, Japan overtook France to become the country with the 
      most 3-starred Michelin restaurants; as of 2018, the capital 
      Tokyo has maintained the title of the city with the most 
      3-starred restaurants in the world. In 2013, Japanese cuisine 
      was added to the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List.
